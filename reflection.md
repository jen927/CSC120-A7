Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
Cafe: sellCoffee(), Cafe()
I overloaded sellCoffee() because usually a coffee shop has a recipe to follow for a coffee unless the customer says otherwise. I overloaded Cafe() because shops usually have a set of inventory, but each week, month, day, or year can differ in inventory.
House: moveOut(), moveIn()
I overloaded these two methods because usually multiple students are moving in or out at a time.
Library: Library(), returnBook()
I overloaded Library() because libraries with one floor logically wouldn't have an elavator. I overloaded returnBook() because sometimes people return multiple titles in one go, so it would make sense to have those titles in an arraylist that can iterate each title and change its status.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think it took my awhile to understand the difference between overloading and overridding. I still get a bit confuse, but what helped me is seeing examples of people comparing the two. Seeing both side by side helped a lot. I would tell someone who is planning on takin this class is to ask questions for clarifaction! Also, talk to your peers on the discord server. What didn't work was staring at my computer for hours until I got the courage to ask for help.
